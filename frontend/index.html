                            A standard deduction is a fixed dollar amount that taxpayers can subtract from their
                            adjusted gross income (AGI) to reduce their taxable income. It is typically a simpler
                            alternative to itemizing deductions, where individual expenses like mortgage interest or
                            medical bills must be tracked and proven with receipts.

                                Choosing between the old and new tax regimes in India depends on your specific financial

                                can claim. The new tax regime is the default option and is generally better for those
                                with minimal deductions, while the old tax regime is better if you have substantial
