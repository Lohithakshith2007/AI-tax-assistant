    <h2>Why this exists</h2>
    <p>
      Many tax-related resources online are either too complex for beginners
      or oversimplified without real understanding. This project was created
      to bridge that gap by explaining concepts clearly while staying
      technically accurate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>Learning-focused design</h2>
    <p>
      This assistant is intentionally designed as a learning-first AI.
      It prioritizes explanations, reasoning, and structured guidance over
      raw calculations or automation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>What this project demonstrates</h2>
    <p>
      The project demonstrates practical full-stack development concepts
      including frontend UI design, backend API integration, AI-assisted
      responses, and real-world project structuring.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>Who this project is for</h2>
    <p>
      This project is suitable for students, early professionals, and
      developers who want to understand how AI can be integrated into
      educational tools rather than used as a black-box solution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>Technology used</h2>
    <p>
